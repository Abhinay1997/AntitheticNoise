There are 3 files: flux_antithetic.py, wan_antithetic.py, sdxl_antithetic.py, the idea of antithetic noise is to use a gaussian random noise and its negative which corresponds to the antipodal smaple on the gaussian hypersphere from which noise is being sampled. This is what I do in prepare_latents method in each of the files here. I also have an additional file called prompts.py where I store my test prompts. I have a callback that tracks the noise_pred and latents for every timestep and computes the pearson correlation for each pair.
